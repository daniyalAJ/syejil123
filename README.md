There are two files in this repository, ML_Model.ipynb and main.py. The ML Model file has detailed documentation of the code in markdown cells, and is self explanatory. The model was compiled on a Mac M1 Apple silicon chip with arm86 architecture. Reproducing results may lead to slight changes as optimization process on different architectures can vary. 

Due to simplicity of the ML task, I was not able to demonstrate more complex methods which I find my expertise in. Please note I have not had the chance to work professionally with APIs before, however I have stayed up the last two nights learning from countless resources and hundreds of open stackoverflow tabs, because I intend to learn in face of any technical challenge presented. 

Due to my limited knowledge and experience in this domain, I have been able to build my first API, which is capable of recieving a text string through a POST request and return the prediction. It was tested using postman, and unfortunately more reproducible methods of testing could not be created. Moreover, I was not able to dockerize my deployment, and I understand that would have a negative impact on my submission.

Please do provide feedback on the submission, I would love to hear back from your company about what you liked best and what could be made better.
